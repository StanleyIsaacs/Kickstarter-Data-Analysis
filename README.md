# Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Dates and Goals

Using Kickstarter data to determine when the best months to launch a campaign for a theater production as well as the most successful goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges


From filtering and constructing a chart, it shows that the most successful time to launch a fundraiser on Kickstarter is the middle of the year and specifically June. The beginning of the year and end of the year have the fewest campaign launches. Failed campaigns have hold pretty steady throughout the year. As far as goals go, the most successful campaigns were on the lower level asking for $1000 or less. There is a small pocket of success in the $35,000 to $45,000 range but otherwise, any theater campaigns over $1000 are unlikely to succeed based on the data. 

Challenges were mainly due to the sheer amount of data available and the specificity of Lucy's campaign. To deal with this, I filtered the subcategory out to "plays" and then sorted by both the month launched and success rates based on goals to provide a clear picture of when to launch the Kickstarter and what a realistic goal should be.
