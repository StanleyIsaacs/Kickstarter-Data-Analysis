# Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Dates and Goals

Using Kickstarter data to determine when the best months to launch a campaign for a theater production as well as the most successful goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges


From filtering and constructing a chart, it shows that the most successful time to launch a fundraiser on Kickstarter is the middle of the year and specifically June. The beginning of the year and end of the year have the fewest campaign launches. Failed campaigns have hold pretty steady throughout the year. As far as goals go, the most successful campaigns were on the lower level asking for $1000 or less. There is a small pocket of success in the $35,000 to $45,000 range but otherwise, any theater campaigns over $1000 are unlikely to succeed based on the data. 

Challenges were mainly due to the sheer amount of data available and the specificity of Lucy's campaign. To deal with this, I filtered the subcategory out to "plays" and then sorted by both the month launched and success rates based on goals to provide a clear picture of when to launch the Kickstarter and what a realistic goal should be.

## Results

Based on launch date, I recommend starting the campaign in June and Avoiding the beginning and end of the year which is generally a slower time to start fundraising. The success rate at the beginning and end of the year is only slightly about fifty percent. 

When looking at goals I recommend keeping the asks on the lower end at $5000 dollars or below. As the asks get higher, the success rate plummets. There is a brief blip in the $35,000 to $45,000 dollar range that proves to be successful but I would recommend staying at $5000 or below. 

## Limitations

Currently we are not sorting by country but that is absolutely a possibility. Where will the play be taking place? It is possible that the data will vary by location. I would like to filter the data out even more and include charts based on country. Since we want to keep the goal at $5000 or below, I'd like to filter out all the projects with that goal. Then break it down even more so I can see the data points in increments of $500 instead of $5000 to see specifically in that 0-5000 range we should choose.
